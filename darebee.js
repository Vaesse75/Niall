	"@Co-op Workout: The **Co-op Workout** can continue if anyone is interested.  In a short while, we'll be done with the current Darebee program.  So now it's time to vote for our next program.

	Repeat Current Program:
	:ballot_box_with_check: "+ProgramName+" <https://darebee.com/programs/"+ProgramURL+".html>.  (If we repeat, we could all attempt to work to a higher level than we did previously.)

	<Chosen Level(s)>

	Respond below with the associated emoji to vote for your preference (I'll seed one of each).  You can vote for more than one option.  In case of a tie for winner, we'll revote with only the tied options and one vote per person.  (Note: If we EVER start a program and agree it's too challenging to keep up with, we can drop back and re-decide.)

	Meanwhile, Sophie has generously created a challenge for the party that mirrors the Take This challenge.  There will be a gem reward randomly assigned, so please participate!  <https://habitica.com/challenges/2d4ab911-4db9-488c-ba2d-96975b0d3e1b>

	Or you can join the "Co-Op Workout" *archieved* Take This challenge <https://habitica.com/challenges/ed1a0476-10e5-4a20-8b3c-6dcd1842d545>.  It will not have the Take This reward gear, but will give you the tasks and never expires."
